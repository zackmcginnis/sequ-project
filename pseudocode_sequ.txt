SEQU CL0


User will specify two command line args as ints
DEF SEQU
we must convert any input to int type
range demands arg1 =< arg2

if arg1 > arg2, return nothing
else, range(arg1, arg2 + 1)
print all i's in range sequence 

DEF MAIN
args = PARSER.parse_args()
enter seqrange func

main

SEQU CL1

Create two groups of optional command line args
"separator" will be specified and placed in it's own group,
and it's value will be stored in 'separator'

"format" and "equal width" are placed in their own group.
their values will be stored in 'formatString' and 'width' respectively.

the 'separator', 'formatString', and 'width' args are implemented 
in main function, before we call sequ function.

sequ function is changed to return floatRange output as 'map'.
'map' is then manipulated in 'main' function.

in main function, formatString value is specified based on user input.

separator is defined in order to be used within the function.

sequ is called inside of the map function, mapping it as a list using formatString input.
The map function is placed within the reduce function, which concatenates the list of strings.
the given separator is used in between each of the strings to produce the desired output.
